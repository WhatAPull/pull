            only in a `title`. Three things were wrong with that, and they compound.

            It is destructive and irreversible: a guest has no address and no password,
            so the token in this browser IS the credential, and ending the session
            deletes an evening of reading with no way to get it back. A `title` needs a
            hover, so a keyboard reader tabbing to it never sees the warning, and a
            screen reader treats it as a description of a button that already has a name
            and mostly does not announce it. The disclosure that does exist in text
            lived on /account -- which this same commit withholds from a guest's
            navigation, so it was written for an audience that could not reach it.

            And it frequently did not even sign anyone in. `signOut()` alone only
            reaches the sign-in screen from an address that is not a public route; from
            /explore, /search, /appearance or a shared source -- all of which a guest
            can be on -- the session ended and the shell simply re-rendered as a
            visitor, so the reader lost everything and gained nothing.

            So this navigates to /account instead, which for a guest is the panel below:
            the consequence in plain visible text, and the destructive step behind a
            second, deliberate press. /account is not a public route, so `signOut()`
            there does land on the sign-in screen -- the one place it always worked.

              The feed is hidden rather than unmounted, and that is a correctness
              choice rather than a performance one.

              `readCount`, `recalled` and `savedThisSession` live in `Feed`. Unmounting
              on a tab switch reset all three to zero and the reporting effect then
              pushed those zeros straight into the rail — so reading five ideas, saving
              two, glancing at the Library and coming back showed 0 / 0 / 0. A product
              whose whole claim is an honest account of one sitting had a counter that
              forgot the sitting whenever you looked away from it. `Feed` argues at
              length about never inflating that number; silently zeroing it is the same
              failure pointed the other way.

              It also refetched page 0 on every return, reshuffling the reader's place.

              `hidden` is enough on both counts: a `display: none` subtree has no
              layout, so IntersectionObserver reports nothing intersecting and no card
              can be counted as read while the reader is elsewhere. It is also removed
              from the accessibility tree, so the hidden feed is not reachable by a
              screen reader or by tabbing.
