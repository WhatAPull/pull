/**
 * Do the app and the database disagree about what exists?
 *
 * Two things ship this product and only one of them is automatic. Vercel redeploys
 * `apps/web` on every push to `main`; migrations reach the hosted project only when
 * somebody runs `supabase db push`. So a pull request that adds a column and selects
 * it — which is an ordinary, correct pull request — puts a query for that column in
 * front of every reader the moment it merges, and the column arrives whenever the
 * next person remembers.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical and it is why this exists. On 2026-09-01 the hosted project
 * was seven migrations behind, `works.source_url` did not exist there, and every source
 * page a reader opened from a card answered "Something went wrong reaching the library"
 * — with `column works.source_url does not exist` printed underneath in the small grey
 * line nobody reads as an instruction.
 *
 * The reader cannot act on either sentence. Whoever runs the deployment can act on this
 * one immediately, and it is the difference between an afternoon of bisecting the
 * frontend and one command.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. These codes say the app asked for something the
 * database does not have. They do NOT say which side is behind, and the first draft of
 * this claimed they did. A column dropped on purpose by a newer migration, read by an
 * older bundle out of the service worker's cache — which law 3 guarantees exists — is
 * the same code with the direction reversed, and there the answer is a reload, not a
 * migration. `PGRST204` inverts it a second way: it comes from PostgREST's schema cache,
 * which goes stale *after* a migration is applied, and is answered by
 * `notify pgrst, 'reload schema'` rather than by pushing anything.
 *
 * So the name is a description of the symptom and the copy says only that the two are
 * out of step. The commands belong here, in front of whoever is reading the repository,
 * and in `console.warn` — not asserted at a reader who cannot act on any of them.
 *
 * The codes: `42703` is Postgres refusing a column; `42P01` a table; `42883` a function,
 * which is how a missing RPC arrives once PostgREST has passed it through. `PGRST202`
 * and `PGRST204` are PostgREST's own versions of the last two, raised from its cached
 * schema before the query is sent, and they carry no SQLSTATE at all. All five are the
 * same fact — this deployment's schema and this bundle disagree — and the four beyond
 * the first matter because 20260901140000, 150000 and 190000 add functions that a
 * project behind on migrations does not have.

/**
 * Could Postgres itself have refused this, for a reason a retry cannot change?
 *
 * The offline queue retries a failed write until it lands, and for a network
 * failure or an unwell server that is right. It is wrong for a write the server
 * has looked at and refused for a reason that will not change: a save for a pull
 * that was deleted while the reader was offline. Those kept `hasPending` true and
 * the retry timer alive for the life of the tab -- one IndexedDB read and one
 * request every five minutes, forever -- and the roadmap carried it as a known gap
 * because the obvious bound, "give up after N attempts", trades it for the worse
 * failure of silently discarding something the reader did.
 *
 * So the classification is conservative and by SQLSTATE, not by count:
 *
 *   23503  foreign key -- the row this write points at is gone
 *   23514  check violation -- the value can never be accepted
 *   22P02  invalid text representation -- an id that is not a uuid at all
 *
 * and it is only half the decision. Whether one of these is *final* depends on
 * what the write is, which this module does not know: a collection's foreign key
 * can point at a collection that is itself still queued, and a check on text the
 * reader typed is a value they would rather be told about than lose. `offline.ts`
 * makes that call per write; this says only whether the code is one that can be.
 *
 * Not on the list, and deliberately: 42501. RLS refuses as `anon` too, and a
 * request goes out as `anon` whenever the session's refresh has failed --
 * transiently, on a laptop whose wifi came back before its DNS did -- so the
 * code cannot tell "this account may never do this" from "this account was not
 * attached to the request". Dropping every queued write in that minute is the
 * exact failure this classification exists to avoid.
 *
 * Everything else stays queued: transport failures, 5xx, a rate limit, an expired
 * token, and a schema mismatch -- which `isSchemaMismatch` recognises and which a
 * pending migration or a reload resolves. Not knowing is the same as transient;
 * the cost of a wrong "permanent" is a lost write, and the cost of a wrong
 * "transient" is a retry.
