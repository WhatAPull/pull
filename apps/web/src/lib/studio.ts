/**
 * The text of an imported source, built from the highlights themselves — and only as
 * much of it as one summary can take.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC, which is why this is a function rather than a template literal at the
 * call site. The same highlights must produce byte-identical text on two presses: the
 * pipeline hashes what it is given and dedupes canonical work on `works.content_hash`,
 * and a screen that shuffled its own input would make every property keyed on that hash
 * meaningless. Order comes from the rows as they were kept — the caller hands them in
 * that order and this does not re-sort — and the locator rides on its own line so the
 * model can cite where a passage came from without it running into the passage.
 * Highlights are joined by a blank line rather than a separator glyph: they are passages
 * from one book, not a list, and the pipeline's own segmentation reads paragraphs.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT BUY, on the path this output actually takes: reuse. `template` adopts
 * the reader's existing work rather than calling `upsertWork`, so no `works` row ever
 * carries this text's hash and `findPublishedSummaryByHash` cannot find it — a second
 * generation of the same book runs the full paid walk again. That is a real gap rather
 * than a subtlety, and closing it is a design question the adopt path raises and does not
 * answer: the reader's work already carries TWO readable summaries by then (the import's
 * and the generated one), so a hash lookup has to be told which of them it is looking
 * for. Named here rather than implied away; the screen warns instead, which is the honest
 * interim.
 *
 * It was two functions until a review pointed out that the second reproduced the first
 * inline: two copies of the code whose bytes decide `works.content_hash`, held together
 * by a test asserting they agree.
 *
 * `checkSubmission` refuses anything over `MAX_TEXT_CHARS` with "Send it in parts",
 * which the paste box can act on and the picker cannot: the only granularity it offers
 * is a whole book. A reader with four thousand Kindle highlights in one title — which is
 * the reader the Studio's own copy describes — could therefore never use it at all.
 *
 * So the text is cut to a whole number of highlights and the screen says so BEFORE the
 * press. Cut rather than sampled, and from the front rather than the middle: the order
 * is the order they were kept, a prefix of it is still a book read from the beginning,
 * and — the property this has to keep — it is deterministic, so two presses hash to the
 * same `works.content_hash` and the second does not pay again.
 *
 * `used` is how many highlights went in — rows with nothing in them are not among them —
 * and `total` how many there were. Equal means nothing was left out and the screen says
 * nothing; `used` of zero with a non-empty book means not one highlight fits.
