 * A question that can be wrong, graded on the device.
 *
 * Every question in this product used to be free recall: the reader was shown a
 * prompt, remembered what they could, and graded themselves. That is honest but it
 * cannot be *wrong* — there is nothing to compare an answer against, so a confident
 * misremembering scores the same as a confident memory. Multiple choice, cloze and
 * ordering questions can be wrong, and that is the entire point of them: the
 * "confidently wrong" repair loop needs an answer the reader gave and an answer the
 * question holds.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and runs in the browser. Grading a multiple-choice
 * answer is a string comparison; grading a typed cloze is an edit distance. Neither
 * needs a model, and neither may ever call one — law 2 puts no model in the read
 * path, and a question answered a thousand times a day is the read path. The
 * questions themselves are written once at generation time (or by hand for the
 * seeded corpus) and served as rows.
 *
 * Nothing in this module touches the database. The question shape is declared here
 * because it is the shape the graders need; the migration that stores it mirrors
 * this, not the other way round.
 */

/**
 * The kinds a question can be.
 *
 * A mirror of a database constraint again, and this time it is one.
 * `quiz_questions.kind` was plain `text not null default 'recall'` with nothing but
 * the unique `(pull_id, kind)` index on it, and this comment said so — the set was
 * *intended* and unenforced, so a row could arrive carrying a kind that is not here.
 * `20260905120001_and_the_question_it_asks.sql` closes that: the check on
 * `quiz_questions.kind` is these six values, in this order, and
 * `supabase/tests/questions.sql` refuses an unknown one.
 *
 * NOTHING MAKES THE TWO MOVE TOGETHER. `packages/db/src/enum-parity.ts` asserts
 * against Postgres ENUM types, and this is a text column with a check, which the
 * generated types render as plain `string`. So a seventh kind added to the migration
 * and not to this list typechecks and ships. Treating an unknown kind as ungraded is
 * therefore still the rule for every consumer — not because Postgres permits one, but
 * because this file and Postgres can still drift.
 *
 * `user_questions.kind` is deliberately the FIRST FOUR only. `ordering` needs its
 * steps in a canonical sequence and `scenario` needs a situation composed around the
 * idea; neither is something the "Remember this" box — a prompt and an answer — can
 * express, so a reader who wants either writes a `short_answer`.
 *
 * (The sibling claim about `confidence` mirroring `recall_events` is true:
 * 20260905100000 does check it.)
 *
 * Only three are graded here. `recall`, `short_answer` and `scenario` stay
 * self-graded: there is no deterministic way to mark a paragraph the reader
 * composed, and marking it with a model would be a model call per answer.

/**
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A SLIP, and why it is no longer a ratio.
 *
 * Review also asked for the other half of this: a reader who types `color` for
 * `colour` should not be recorded as `confidentlyWrong`, because that field
 * means a false belief and routes them into the misconception loop. The first
 * draft added a near-miss band that suppressed the flag above a similarity
 * threshold, and it was wrong -- `increase marginal utility` against `decrease
 * marginal utility` is 0.92 similar across the string, so the band quietly
 * re-admitted the exact class this rule exists to catch, and the suite said so.
 * The answer is the rule below rather than a second threshold on top of it: a
 * typo IS the answer now, graded `good`, so it never reaches `confidentlyWrong`
 * at all, and what still fails really is a different answer.
 *
 *
 * The rule here was "within two edits, and at least 0.85 similar, per word". A
 * ratio cannot separate the two things it was being asked to: `color` for
 * `colour` is one edit in six letters and a typo, and `efferent` for `afferent`
 * is one edit in eight and a different structure of the nervous system. Review
 * reproduced four of that second kind grading `easy` at 0.875-0.900 --
 * `efferent`/`afferent`, `absorption`/`adsorption`, `intension`/`intention`,
 * `10000000`/`1000000` -- and `easy` is, by this module's own words, the grade a
 * wrong heuristic does the most damage with. It multiplies stability by more
 * than three and takes the idea out of review for a fortnight, and
 * `confidentlyWrong` is false, so nothing downstream ever looks at it again.
 *
 * The distinction that does hold is not how far apart two words are but WHAT
 * KIND of difference it is. A hand slips off a key and drops a letter, doubles
 * one, or swaps two; it does not substitute one letter for another and land on
 * a word that means something else. So an insertion, a deletion or a
 * transposition is forgiven, and a substitution is not:
 *
 *   colour / color          deletion       -> correct
 *   mitochondira            transposition  -> correct
 *   occurrence / ocurrence  deletion       -> correct
 *   efferent / afferent     substitution   -> not correct
 *   absorption / adsorption substitution   -> not correct
 *   intension / intention   substitution   -> not correct
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS, stated because it is a real regression for one class:
 * `ionised` for `ionized` is a substitution and is now graded `forgot`, where
 * the ratio rule accepted it. `similarity` still reports 0.857 so the screen can
 * say how close it came, and the reader sees the idea again tomorrow rather than
 * in three days. That is the cheap direction to be wrong in, and the alternative
 * was letting the opposite of the answer through as `easy`.
 *
 * DIGITS ARE EXACT. A slip in a number is not a spelling variant: `10000000`
 * for `1000000` is an order of magnitude and passed the old rule at 0.875. Any
 * word containing a digit has to match exactly.

 * ON THE FOLDED FORMS ONLY, and the second chance on the raw ones is gone.
 *
 * It was added so `colur` for `colour` stayed a slip: the fold rewrites one side and
 * not the other, so a dropped letter inside a folded word turns from a deletion into a
 * substitution, which is never a slip. That is a real cost of folding at all.
 *
 * The raw retry cost more. An exhaustive sweep of a 370k-word list found 52 pairs it
 * newly accepts — `fires` for `fibres`, `amour` for `armour`, `tires` for `titres`,
 * `mires` for `mitres` — where the folded comparison correctly refuses and the raw one
 * sees an ordinary indel. `fires`/`fibres` is two common words and `fibre` is an
 * ordinary cloze answer, so that is a wrong answer recorded as recalled, which this
 * module calls the one outcome a grader must never produce. Refusing a mistyped
 * `colour` is the smaller harm, and it is the same class the cost paragraph in
 * `gradeCloze` already discloses.
 *
 * No shape separates the two cases — `colur` and `fires` are both one indel from the
 * unfolded answer, and only a dictionary knows that one of them is a word.
 *
 * AND THE COST IS ~7,969 SLIP/ANSWER PAIRS, which is the number this paragraph used to
 * avoid. It was written as "52 pairs the raw retry newly accepts" against a cost given
 * only as a class, and a trade stated one-sided is not a trade a reader can check.
 * Measured the same way as the 52: every single deletion, doubling and adjacent
 * transposition of all 8,099 words in a 370,105-word list that the fold rewrites,
 * graded before and after. 7,969 accepted before and refused now; 0 the other way.
 *
 * The direction is still right, and that is why this stands. A refused slip grades
 * `forgot` and the idea comes round again; an accepted wrong word grades up to `easy`
 * and takes the idea out of review for a fortnight, which this module calls the one
 * outcome a grader must never produce. 52 of the second is worse than 7,969 of the
 * first.
 *
 * The earlier account of WHICH slips was also wrong, and worth correcting because it
 * made the cost sound self-limiting. It said the cost bites "only where the fold is
 * itself an INDEL" -- `colour` -> `color` drops a letter, `theatre` -> `theater` keeps
 * its length -- so the `-re` family was safe. It is not: 2,581 of the regressions are on
 * same-length folds, and `sceptic` -> `skeptic` and `grey` -> `gray` are substitutions
 * that regress too. `theatr` survives by where the slip falls, not by the shape of the
 * fold -- past the folded region it is still an indel, and `teatre`, `thatre` and
 * `cntre` are all refused. What decides is whether the typo lands at or before the
 * folded region, not what the fold does.
 *
 * One consequence is worth naming because it is the one a reader feels: a doubled
 * keystroke in `centre`, answered `sure`, now grades `forgot` AND sets
 * `confidentlyWrong`. Withholding that flag on the SHAPE of a typo was tried and is
 * recorded in `gradeCloze` as worse -- it silenced eleven real confusions with exactly
 * that shape -- so it is disclosed here rather than patched.

 * Why the option the reader picked is wrong, in the question's own words.

 * Each distractor can carry a rationale, and that is what makes a wrong answer
 * worth more than a right one: the reader learns which specific confusion they

 * Picking the answer is not wrong, so there is nothing to say and this is null.
 *
 * "THE ANSWER" HERE MEANS EXACTLY THE ANSWER, and for a cloze that is stricter than the
 * grader. `gradeCloze` accepts a typing slip and a spelling variant -- `colour` for
 * `color` grades `correct: true` -- while this compares trimmed strings, so it does not
 * treat that reader as right. What it returns is then whatever the question carries: the
 * matching rationale, or the general explanation, or null when it has neither. That is right for the MCQ case the function was written
 * for, where picking an option either is or is not the answer, and it means a screen
 * must NOT decide whether to show a reason by asking whether this is null. Show one when
 * the GRADER said the reader was wrong; ask this only for the words to put in it.
