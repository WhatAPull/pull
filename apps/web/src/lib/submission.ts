 * one millisecond share a value — and equal timestamps carry no information
 * about which came first, which is the one thing the server needs to order
 * them. Advancing by a millisecond whenever the clock has not moved makes that
 * impossible within a tab: every stamp this returns is greater than the last.
 *
 * It is deliberately per-tab. Making it monotonic across tabs would need an
 * origin-wide lock around a stored counter on every submission, and the race it
 * would close — two tabs answering the same card inside the same millisecond —
 * is not reachable by someone clicking. The remaining tie resolves to whichever
 * submission reaches the database second, which is no worse than arbitrary and
 * no longer discards a stance.
 *
 * It can run ahead of the wall clock, by at most one millisecond per submission
 * in a burst. That is the point: it is an ordering token, not a timestamp, and
 * the server compares it only against other stamps from the same reader.

/**
 * One mutation id AND one submission stamp per DRAFT, decided in one place and never

 *
 * `Path.tsx` minted a fresh `mutationId()` inside its click handler, and its catch only
 * logged -- so a lost response followed by a second click wrote a second conviction,
 * explanation or note, each under an id the server had never seen. Every one of those
 * writes deduplicates on the id, which is only worth anything if a retry carries the
 * same one.
 *
 * THE STAMP TRAVELS WITH THE ID, and that is the second half of the same fix (review
 * finding). `set_conviction` orders a reader's stances by `submitted_at`, so a retry
 * that reused the id but minted a new stamp would tell the server the reader decided
 * LATER than they did -- and if the first request never reached the database while
 * another tab recorded a newer stance in between, the stale retry would supersede the
 * newer stance. That is the exact inversion `submitted_at` exists to prevent, so a
 * draft's stamp is fixed at the first attempt and every retry sends both provenance
 * values unchanged.
 *
 * Keyed by what is being submitted rather than held and cleared: `Source.tsx`'s
 * `askMutations` is deleted on success, on every edit and on dismissal, and that
 * discipline has been lost three times on one file. Here the caller names the draft --
 * the step and its content -- and the same name gets the same id and stamp however
 * many times it is sent, even with other drafts sent in between, while an edited draft
 * is a different name and gets fresh ones. That is what an edit has to mean: the
 * server would otherwise answer with the FIRST wording and silently discard the new
 * one.
 *
 * `mint` and `stamp` are parameters so the test can count how often each is called.
