/**
 * How a queued write turns back into the call that makes it real.
 *
 * This lived inside the Feed's drain effect as an if/else chain ending in a bare
 * `else await api.recordRead(write.pullId, 0, 0)` — a default branch that
 * silently claimed every kind it had not been taught. That is fine while every
 * member of `PendingWrite` carries a `pullId`; the moment one does not, a
 * collection delete replays as a read of `undefined` and nobody hears about it.
 * A `switch` over the discriminant with no default makes the compiler refuse the
 * next kind that is added without a branch here.
 *
 * It is also the reason this is a module rather than a closure. The suite runs
 * in `environment: 'node'`, so anything inside a component is untestable, and
 * "which call does this queued write become" is exactly the kind of ordinary
 * mapping that should not need a browser to check.
 *
 * The calls arrive as a port rather than being imported for real: `api.ts` and
 * `stash-api.ts` construct the Supabase client on import and throw without
 * `VITE_*` env, so a value import here would make this module untestable for a
 * dependency it only needs at runtime. The two `import type` lines above are
 * erased, and they are what keeps the port honest — the shapes are read off the
 * real functions, so a signature that changes breaks this file rather than
 * drifting away from it silently.
