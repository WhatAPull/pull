/**
 * Read-aloud, free forever (CLAUDE.md law 3) — and dictation, which is not the same thing.
 *
 * `speechSynthesis` is on the device, so read-aloud costs nothing per user and needs no
 * server. Deepstash puts playback behind Pro; here it is affordable precisely because of
 * where it runs.
 *
 * "On the device" has one qualification, and `listVoices` exists to make it. A browser
 * ships local voices and may also offer remote ones — Chrome's "Google" voices synthesise
 * on Google's servers, which means the text of the card goes there to be read. That is
 * a smaller thing than dictation (the text is a published summary, not a reader's
 * voice) but it is still a network round trip and it still does not work offline, so
 * the local voices come first in the list AND a reader who picks nothing gets one --
 * in their own language, or the browser's default if the device has none. See
 * `preferredLocalVoice`, which is where that stops being a claim about the list and
 * becomes a property of the utterance.
 *
 * PAUSE IS CANCEL PLUS A REMEMBERED OFFSET, not `speechSynthesis.pause()`. The native
 * call is unreliable where it matters most: on Chrome for Android it either does
 * nothing or ends the utterance outright, and `resume()` after it starts again from
 * the top; on desktop Chrome an utterance paused for more than about fifteen seconds
 * is quietly killed by the engine and never resumes at all. So pausing here cancels
 * the utterance and remembers the `charIndex` of the last `onboundary` event — the
 * start of the word being spoken — and resuming speaks the text again from that word.
 * One path that behaves the same everywhere beats a native path that is only true on
 * the machines we do not have. The cost is honest: an engine that fires no boundary
 * events (Chrome Android's remote voices among them) resumes from the start of the
 * utterance, and a card is a paragraph, so the price is a paragraph.
 *
 * `SpeechRecognition` is **not** the same bargain, and this header used to vouch for both.
 * In most browsers it streams the captured audio to that browser's own speech
 * service — Chrome to Google, Safari to Apple, Edge to Microsoft; only a few
 * configurations run it locally. It still costs us nothing
 * and calls no model of ours — law 2 is untouched — but "on the device" is false for it,
 * and a reader pressing Dictate is sending their voice to their browser's vendor. That is
 * their call to make, so `docs/privacy.md` says so and the control says so beside itself.
 * Nothing here records, stores or transmits audio to us.
