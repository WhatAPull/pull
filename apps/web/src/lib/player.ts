/**
 * The player — a queue of things to hear, as a pure reducer.
 *
 * Read-aloud is free forever (CLAUDE.md law 3) because it is `speechSynthesis`
 * on the device, and until now it was also stateless: one card, one utterance,
 * and a Stop button. That is a Listen control, not a player. A reader who wants
 * to hear a source on a walk needs a queue that outlives the card it was started
 * from — surviving a tab change, a navigation to the Library, a lock screen.
 *
 * The state lives here, in a reducer with no DOM in it, for the reason
 * `packages/ranking` mirrors the planner in TypeScript: every transition can be
 * asserted without a browser. The effect layer — the thing that actually calls
 * `speak` and listens for the utterance to end — is a separate concern that
 * subscribes to this state and dispatches back into it. What that layer must
 * never do is keep its own idea of what is playing.
 *
 * Two rules are worth stating before the actions, because they decide the feel
 * of the thing:
 *
 *   * ADVANCING IS THE PLAYER'S ACT, NOT THE READER'S. Design law 7 forbids
 *     sliding the next card into frame while *reading*; listening is different,
 *     and a queue that stopped after every item would be a Listen button with
 *     extra steps. So `next` is what the effect layer dispatches when an
 *     utterance ends, and it walks the queue until the queue runs out.
 *   * THE END IS AN END. When the last track finishes the queue is cleared and
 *     the player goes idle. Nothing is remembered to be replayed, because a
 *     finished session that lingers as "Paused · 5 of 5" on the next visit is a
 *     feed that never ends, wearing headphones.
 *
 * THE EFFECT LAYER'S CONTRACT, so it can be written once and not re-derived, and
 * keyed on THE EPOCH IT IS SPEAKING rather than on the previous state's — which is
 * the only reading that works, and review found the ambiguity the hard way. Track
 * the epoch you last called `speak` under. Whenever the status is `playing` and the
 * state's epoch differs from that one, call `speak` on the current track and hand
 * the new epoch back in `ended`; when the status becomes `paused`, pause; when it
 * returns to `playing` with the epoch you are already speaking, resume; when it
 * becomes `idle`, stop.
 *
 * Read instead as "the epoch changed at this transition", a restore from storage
 * (hydrated at epoch 0, then Resume) would call `resume()` on an utterance that was
 * never started — so that reading was never implementable, and the sleep-timer pause
 * is simply the case that made it obvious. A rate or voice change while something is
 * playing is applied to the live utterance in place (`adjustSpeaking` in
 * `lib/speech.ts` keeps the reader's position) and does not touch the epoch.
