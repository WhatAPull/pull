/*
 * Every table holding rows that belong to a reader, the column that says so, and a
 * column that ORDERS them.
 *
 * The order is not decoration, and neither is what is done with it. This used to order
 * by `column` — the same value on every row that survived the filter, so it ordered
 * nothing, and PostgREST was free to return page 2 overlapping page 1.
 *
 * A TOTAL ORDER WAS NECESSARY AND NOT SUFFICIENT, and the first version of this comment
 * claimed otherwise: it said the ordering fixed the case where another tab inserts a row
 * mid-export. It does not. `.range(from, from + 99)` is `LIMIT/OFFSET`, and an offset is
 * unstable under concurrent writes however well ordered the rows are — a row that lands
 * before the current offset shifts every later page by one, so the file carries one row
 * twice and omits another while `incomplete` stays empty. Measured on 250 rows: row 109
 * duplicated, the concurrently inserted row absent, and the document still claiming to
 * be whole. Because `id` is `gen_random_uuid()`, an inserted row lands at a random
 * position, so roughly half of all mid-export writes do this.
 *
 * So the walk is keyset now: order by `key`, ask for what sorts after the last one seen,
 * and carry that forward. Nothing shifts under a cursor that names a row rather than
 * counting from the start.
 *
 * `key` is therefore a column unique WITHIN one reader's rows, which makes it both a
 * total order and a usable cursor: the primary key where it is a single `id`, and the
 * other half of a composite key where it is not. Where no one column is unique within a
 * reader's rows -- `path_step_done` is a step of a path, `(path_id, ordinal)` -- `key` is
 * the pair, and the cursor is the pair: a single column there would skip every row that
 * shares the last one's first half at a page's end.
