/**
 * Listening — how fast, in whose voice, and for how long before it stops.
 *
 * Three settings, device-scoped, in `localStorage`, for the reasons
 * `lib/appearance.ts` gives for the display settings and one more that is
 * specific to sound:
 *
 *   * A visitor can listen now. Read-aloud is free forever (law 3) and needs no
 *     account, so a rate chosen while signed out has to be kept somewhere that
 *     exists while signed out.
 *   * A VOICE IS A PROPERTY OF THE DEVICE, NOT THE READER. `voiceURI` names an
 *     engine installed on this machine; the same string means nothing on the
 *     phone. A synced column would faithfully carry a laptop's voice to a
 *     device that cannot produce it, and the reader would get the fallback
 *     with no idea why. Per-device is the only scope in which the setting is
 *     even true.
 *   * The sleep timer is a habit rather than a decision — "thirty minutes, most
 *     nights" — and the device by the bed is the one that has it.
 *
 * This module also remembers the QUEUE, because it is the one place that touches
 * storage on the player's behalf and a second module with the same try/catch
 * would be a copy. The queue's shape and its owner check live in `lib/player.ts`;
 * this only reads and writes the string — and decides WHICH store it goes in,
 * which is a different decision from the three settings above and is made at
 * `queueStore` below.
 *
 * Every storage access is guarded. `localStorage` throws rather than returning
 * null in a browser set to block site data, and an unguarded read here would be
 * the exception that stops the app rendering at all.

/**
 * Where a QUEUE is kept, which is not the same question as where a preference is.
 *
 * A rate, a voice and a sleep timer are facts about the device — the machine is
 * fast, the machine has this voice installed, this is the machine by the bed —
 * so `localStorage` is right for them and a second person at the same machine
 * learns nothing from finding them.
 *
 * A queue is not. It is a list of titles and their text: what someone chose to
 * listen to. `lib/guest-storage.ts` already decided what to do with material
 * belonging to a reader who has no address, and the reasoning transfers exactly:
 * `localStorage` survives a browser restart, so on a shared machine the next
 * person to open the browser would find the previous one's reading list loaded
 * and ready to play. That module puts a guest's token in `sessionStorage` for
 * precisely that reason; this puts their queue there for the same one.
 *
 * `durable` is ANDed with `userId !== null` at both call sites, because the one
 * thing it must never mean is durable storage for somebody with no address:
 * `storePlayer(queue, null, true)` used to write a signed-out visitor's reading list
 * to `localStorage`, which is precisely the state this module was changed to remove.
 * That was a convention in a comment; it is a condition now.
 *
 * Beyond that it is passed rather than derived, because it cannot be derived here. A
 * null `userId` is a signed-out visitor and a non-null one may still be a guest —
 * an anonymous account with a real uuid — and only the caller holding the session
 * can tell a guest from a reader with an address. It defaults to `false` so a
 * caller who forgets loses persistence rather than leaks a reading list; that is
 * the direction this has to fail in.
