 * What the browser tab, the history entry and the screen reader should call this page.

 * `index.html` set `<title>What a Pull</title>` once and nothing ever changed it, so
 * every screen, every source and every search reported the same six characters. Three
 * things depend on that string and all three were broken by it: a tab strip with four
 * of this app open is unusable, browser history is a list of identical rows, and a
 * screen reader announces the same title after every navigation, which is the one
 * signal a non-visual reader has that the page changed at all.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from `App` for the reason `routes.ts` gives about itself: the
 * mapping is the part worth testing, and testing it should not require a DOM or a
 * Supabase client.
 *
 * The suffix is dropped on the root so the feed is just the product name rather than
 * "What a Pull · What a Pull". Everything else is `<page> · What a Pull`, narrowest
 * part first, because a tab strip truncates from the right and the distinguishing
 * word has to survive that.
