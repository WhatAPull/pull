/**
 * Offline reading, free forever (CLAUDE.md law 3).
 *
 * Deepstash puts library downloads behind Pro. Here it costs nothing because it
 * runs entirely in the browser: the service worker caches the bundle, and
 * IndexedDB holds the reader's own content plus a queue of writes made while
 * disconnected.
 *
 * Everything in IndexedDB is keyed by account. The queue always was; the page
 * cache was not, and for a while that was a documented gap rather than a
 * design: on a shared computer an offline load could show whoever sat down
 * next the previous reader's feed. Schema version 2 closed it — the cache is
 * keyed `userId:pullId` and read through a `by-user` index, and the rows the
 * old schema held were dropped at upgrade because nothing recorded whose they
 * were. A downloaded review pack, added in the same version, is keyed the same
 * way from the start.
 *
 * Built on the web before any native wrapper, so Capacitor later becomes an
 * enhancement rather than a rescue operation.

/**
 * A queued write, as a union so each kind carries exactly its own payload.
 *
 * Saves and reads are identified entirely by their pull. The two learning
 * writes are not: an explanation is several sentences the reader composed and a
 * conviction is a stance, and both exist nowhere else once the request that
 * carried them fails. They are queued for the same reason the others are, but
 * they are the ones it would actually hurt to lose.
 *
 * Every kind here must be safe to replay, since a queued write is retried
 * whenever its *response* was lost rather than its effect: saves collide on
 * their unique index, `record_read` is idempotent per pull and day, and the two
 * learning writes carry a `mutationId` minted once per submission, which is
 * what lets the server recognise a replay as a submission it already applied
 * — even when a later stance has superseded it in the meantime.
 *
 * `recall` is the one exception, and it earns its place by being queued under a
 * narrower condition instead — see the note on that member. The lasting fix is a
 * mutation id on `grade_recall`, the same treatment `set_conviction` and
 * `save_explanation` already have; until the RPC takes one, the condition is what
 * keeps the invariant.

  /**
   * A recall grade — queued under a stricter rule than everything else here.
   *
   * `grade_recall` is the one write in this app that is **not** safe to replay. It
   * multiplies stability (`stability * (2.0 + …)` for a "good") and increments
   * `reps`, so applying one grade twice roughly squares the interval and the card
   * silently disappears from review for months. There is no unique index to collide
   * with and no mutation id to recognise a replay by, because the RPC takes neither.
   *
   * That makes the two failures asymmetric, and the asymmetry decides the rule.
   * Losing a grade is self-correcting: the card stays due and the reader grades it
   * again. Double-applying one is invisible and wrong in the direction this product
   * cannot afford — a memory model that quietly stops asking.
   *
   * So this kind is queued **only when the request demonstrably never reached the
   * server** — `isOfflineFailure`, which is `navigator.onLine === false` or the
   * PostgREST `code: ''` that means the call never got to Postgres. A 500, a refusal
   * or a timeout mid-flight is dropped rather than queued, because the write may
   * already have applied. See `Review.tsx`.
   *
   * The residual risk is a response lost in transit after the server committed, which
   * looks like a transport failure and is not one. It is the same class of risk the
   * `save` and `read` paths already accept, and it is far smaller than losing every
   * grade of a review session done on a plane — offline being one of the five things
   * law 3 promises free forever.

       * branch of this merge claimed on its own.
       *
       * 4a's schema upgrade stamps an id onto every `recall` entry already on disk
       * (`stampQueuedGrades`), taking `submittedAt` from the entry's own `at` so a grade
       * given three days offline is not backdated to the upgrade. 1b then mints one for
       * everything queued from here on. Between them there is no ordinary path that
       * leaves an entry without one — so 1b's "an entry queued by an older build carries
       * none" is no longer true of the merged file, and neither is 4a's "nothing sends
       * it to the RPC yet", which 1b is precisely the change that does.
       *
       * The field stays optional because the type allows it and a store can be older
       * than any code reasoning about it. An entry that still lacks one replays without
       * it and `grade_recall` applies the write, which is the pre-20260905100000
       * behaviour and the right one for a write queued under the old rules.
       *
       * WHAT STAMPING DOES NOT BUY, said plainly because it looks like it should: it
       * cannot make a lost-response replay idempotent. If the original write reached
       * Postgres and only the response was lost, the id minted at upgrade is a NEW id,
       * so the server cannot match it to the row already written and the grade applies a
       * second time — exactly as it would have with no id at all. What it buys is that
       * the entry's own retries, within a drain and across later ones, are recognised as
       * one attempt. The double-apply on a lost response is closed by 1b minting the id
       * BEFORE the send, not by this.

 * replay from a new grade; minting it here, once, at upgrade, means an entry
 * queued by the old code replays under one stable id from now on rather than
 * being the one write in the store that still cannot be recognised. Done inside
 * the upgrade transaction so it commits with the schema or not at all.
 *
 * `submittedAt` is taken from the entry's own `at` — the moment the write was
 * queued, which is the moment the reader answered — and not from the clock at
 * upgrade. The server orders a late replay against the reader's current state
 * by this value, so stamping it with the upgrade time would tell it a grade
 * from three days offline had just been given.
 *
 * It backfills what is already on disk and nothing more. Everything queued from
 * here on already carries an id — `Review.tsx`, `Feed.tsx` and `KnowledgeCensus`
 * mint one per submission and `drainPending` passes it to `grade_recall` — so the
 * only entries this can find are the ones queued by a build that predates that,

 * Is this refusal final for this write?

 * request it can never satisfy. Whether that is true of *this* request depends on
 * what the request was, and two kinds of write can carry one of those codes
 * transiently:
 *
 *   23503 on a collection write. `stash-create` names a parent and `organise` a
 *   destination, and either may be a collection this same drain is still about
 *   to create -- the parent was queued first and the drain runs oldest first, but
 *   a transport failure on the parent blocks only the parent's scope, so the child
 *   is attempted anyway and refused. It stays queued while its target is queued,
 *   and is dropped only when the target is nowhere: not queued, and not on the
 *   server.
 *
 * Everything else is what the codes were listed for: a pull that is gone is gone,
 * and no later pass brings it back. A check violation is dropped too, and on text
 * the reader composed that is a loss -- but a kept write blocks its scope on every
 * pass and holds the timer alive for the life of the tab, which is the failure this
 * whole classification exists to end. The honest fix is not to let the text get
 * that long: the inputs are bounded to the columns' limits in the components.

 * misconfiguration all rendered "Offline — reading from your downloaded copies" over
 * stale content, on a connection that was plainly working. That is not merely an

 * of failure worth hearing about in the first week of use.
 *

 *
 *   navigator.onLine === false   the browser is certain there is no network. Trusted
 *                                only in this direction — `true` means "an interface
 *                                is up", which is not the same as reachable, so it is
 *                                never used to prove the opposite.
 *   error instanceof TypeError   what `fetch` rejects with directly. Real for a bare
 *                                fetch; almost never seen through supabase-js.
 *   name === TRANSPORT_ERROR     the same failure after postgrest-js has caught it.
 *
 * That third case is the important one and it was missing. postgrest-js does not let
 * a fetch rejection propagate: it resolves with an error object instead, so by the
 * time this is called the `TypeError` is a string inside a message and `instanceof`
 * can never match. Checking only the first two conditions meant a reader on hotel
 * wifi or a dropped VPN — interface up, requests failing — was shown an error while
 * their downloaded Pulls sat unread in IndexedDB. That is a law 3 promise broken in
 * exactly the situation offline reading exists for.

 * Anything else is the server's problem, and should reach the reader as an error they
 * can retry rather than as a shrug about connectivity.
