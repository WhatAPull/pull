/**
 * Studio — a summary of your own text, for you.
 *
 * The one place law 2 bends, and the shape of the bend is the point. Generation
 * still happens at GENERATION time, once, for one reader: nothing here runs per
 * impression, nothing here runs in a read path, and every call writes
 * `cost_ledger`. What changes is who can start one. Until now that was whoever
 * asked for a canonical work; now it is anybody with an account and something of
 * their own to understand.
 *
 * Which is exactly why `20260914010000` exists. The per-requester quotas — three
 * fast a day, a stagger, fifty as a ceiling — bound one reader and bound the
 * product not at all once everybody can spend, so a global daily cap sits under
 * them and this screen says what is left of it before the reader types anything.
 *
 * WHAT THE READER IS TOLD, in their words and before they press anything:
 *
 *   * the text goes to Google, or to Anthropic if Google is unavailable — the set and
 *     not the likely case, because this screen cannot read an Edge Function's
 *     environment and a reader consenting to one processor has not consented to two.
 *     It is the one exception to "nothing about your reading reaches a model", and is
 *     `docs/privacy.md`'s own sentence
 *   * the summary is private and is not published
 *   * how much of today's shared budget is left, and how many of their own jobs
 *
 * None of that is a disclosure buried in a policy: it is the copy on the screen,
 * because the alternative is a button that quietly sends somebody's diary to a
 * model provider.

        The consent line, before the form rather than under the button.
        `docs/privacy.md` names this as the one exception to "nothing about your reading
        reaches a model", and a reader has to meet it before they have typed anything
        rather than after they have decided.

        BOTH PROVIDERS ARE NAMED, which this said only Google. `SUMMARY_FALLBACK_PROVIDER`
        builds a chain that sends the same text to Anthropic when Gemini is unavailable —
        `providers.ts` falls through on `ProviderUnavailableError` — and this screen
        cannot read an Edge Function's environment to know whether a deployment has one
        configured. Consent has to describe what CAN happen to the document somebody is
        about to paste, so it names the set rather than the likely case: over-naming a
        processor is not the direction in which this is harmful.
