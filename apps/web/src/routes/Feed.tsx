   * re-rendered on every player transition, because it consumed the whole player
   * context. So pressing Pause on the bar, or dragging the sleep timer, tore down and
   * rebuilt every visible card's `IntersectionObserver`: the cleanup cleared the

   * stops the dwell clock until the new observer's first callback arrives
   * asynchronously. A reader using the player while the feed was on screen lost dwell
   * measurement and could lose the read event entirely — which this file spends a
   * great deal of effort not getting wrong in the other direction.
   *
   * `usePlayerActions` and `usePlayerSelection` have since taken that re-render away at
   * the source: the actions never change identity and the selection changes only when
   * what is playing or queued does. This stays regardless — the callbacks are still
   * fresh closures on every render of this component, for every other reason a
   * component re-renders.
