/**
 * The player bar — the only thing on screen that outlives the card it was
 * started from.
 *
 * A hairline rule and a line of mono, fixed to the bottom of the window. It is
 * not a media player: no scrubber, no artwork, no waveform, because there is
 * nothing to scrub — `speechSynthesis` has no timeline, and drawing one would be
 * a control that lies. What a listener actually needs is where they are in the
 * queue, a way to stop, and a way to stop LATER.
 *
 * Law 7 and an auto-advancing queue are not in tension, and it is worth saying
 * why, because the same behaviour in the feed is forbidden. The queue is built by
 * the reader, one press at a time; it is finite; it never refills itself; and
 * when it ends, it ends and the bar goes away. That is a playlist, not a feed.
 * Reading is still never advanced for anyone.
 *
 * The bar renders nothing at all when there is nothing queued, so the reserved
 * space below the Colophon is spent only while it is being used — and Done is what
 * makes "nothing queued" reachable on purpose rather than only by playing to the end.
