/**
 * The effect layer the player reducer was written for.
 *
 * `lib/player.ts` holds every transition as a pure function and states, at
 * length, what the layer that actually speaks must do. This is that layer, and
 * it is deliberately the only place in the app that calls `speak`: a queue that
 * outlives the card it was started from cannot be owned by a card.
 *
 * Four jobs, and nothing else:
 *
 *   1. Turn state into sound. Keyed on THE EPOCH IT IS SPEAKING, per the
 *      contract in `lib/player.ts` — not on what changed at a transition, which
 *      is unimplementable for a queue restored from storage at epoch 0.
 *   2. Remember the queue, through `lib/audio-prefs.ts`, which decides whether
 *      it goes anywhere durable.
 *   3. Hold the three listening settings, which are a property of the device
 *      rather than of the queue. The reducer carries a rate and a voice because
 *      an utterance needs them; `lib/audio-prefs.ts` is where they persist, and
 *      this is the seam between the two. The bar and the Appearance screen both
 *      set them through here, so there is one answer rather than two.
 *   4. Tell the operating system what is playing, so the lock screen and a
 *      headset button reach the same reducer the bar does.
 *
 * THE QUEUE BELONGS TO ONE READER, which is why there are two components here.
 * `PlayerEngine` is keyed on the reader's id, so a sign-in or a sign-out gives a
 * new engine that reads its own stored queue and writes only under its own key;
 * the outgoing one's teardown stops the voice mid-sentence, which is exactly
 * what signing out should do to it. `PlayerProvider` does not remount, so it is
 * the one that can see an identity change happen and forget what the previous
 * reader had queued.
