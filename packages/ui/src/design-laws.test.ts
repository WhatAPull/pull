 * a screen asks for it. A `maxWidth: '42rem'` written into a component is neither: it
 * is ~82 characters a line instead of ~66, and it stays 42rem when a reader turns on
 * large text — the one setting a reading column exists to respect. `docs/design.md`:
 * "The reading column stays at `--measure` at every screen size", and "a new fixed

 *
 * The law checked only that no stylesheet REDEFINES `--measure`, so an inline width in

 *
 * `KNOWN_WIDE` is the debt, named rather than exempted by pattern, and the list is the

 * all three are wide grid containers, and that was true of one: `App.tsx` renders
 * `MetacognitiveDashboard` and `OnboardingDemo` inside `<div className="shell__column">`,
 * which `components.css` pins at `max-width: var(--measure)` — so their 42rem is
 * `min(--measure, 42rem)` and never binds. They are DEAD, not wide. `Specimen.tsx`
 * returns before the shell and genuinely is wide.
 *
 * They stay listed because deleting a dead declaration belongs to the change that owns
 * the screen, and because a value that never binds is exactly what somebody would widen
 * without noticing. A fourth entry has to be argued for here, and "it is inside the
 * shell column so it does not matter" is an argument for deleting it instead.
