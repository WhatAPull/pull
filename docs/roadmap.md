# Roadmap

Build order matters: the product should feel good **before** any AI generation exists.
If it is not enjoyable with a hand-seeded public-domain corpus, generation will not save
it.

## Round 1 — the spine ✅

Monorepo with the CI checks, the agentic setup, the first 28 migrations across 38 tables
with RLS everywhere, the read path (ranking · Delta · interleave), a public-domain seed, The
Archive design system, the generation step-machine skeleton, and a working app: auth →
feed → interleaved questions → save → review → Enough.

The free-forever five all land here, each affordable because of where it runs rather than
because of a subsidy: audio (Web Speech, on-device), offline (service worker + IndexedDB),
unlimited history and stashes (rows in Postgres), and Daily Pulls (one shared editorial
query).

**Known gaps carried into round 2**, so they are not rediscovered as surprises:

- Onboarding is not built. New readers get default preferences from the signup trigger and
  an unweighted feed, which works but is not personalised until they have history.
- The Delta's `covered` check scans the reader's known set per candidate. Correct and fast
  at seed scale; it needs a precomputed neighbour table before a library grows large.
- `packages/ranking` mirrors the interleave planner but not the feed scorer. Only the
  planner has a parity test; the scorer lives solely in SQL for now.
- Source pages, Explore, Library and Studio are stubs or absent — `get_source_delta` is
  implemented and tested but has no screen yet.
- Embeddings are synthetic (concept axes). Real ones arrive with the providers in round 2,
  and no read-path code needs to change when they do.
- The generation step-machine is wired and verified but **not deployed**, and runs stub
  providers. Round 2 deploys the Edge Functions, enables the `pg_cron` dispatcher and swaps in
  real providers.
- `public.enqueue_generation_job` is deliberately `SECURITY DEFINER` and callable by signed-in
  readers — the only way to make the job insert and its queue send one transaction, since the
  `authenticated` role has no privilege on `pgmq`. It derives the requester from `auth.uid()`
  and enforces the quota internally. The security advisor notes this by design; it is the one
  advisory the project accepts, and the reasoning is in the migration that grants it.

## Round 2 — generation

### Deployment ✅

The app and the step-machine are live. What that took, so it is repeatable:

- `vercel.json` configures the monorepo build; `apps/web/.env.production` carries the
  publishable key and project URL, so a deploy needs no dashboard step.
- All three Edge Functions are deployed. `worker` runs with `verify_jwt` off and
  authenticates the dispatcher itself — see `supabase/functions/README.md`.
- `enable_generation_dispatcher_with_token` mints a token into Vault and schedules
  `pg_cron` every 10s, so turning generation on never requires reading the service_role
  key out of the dashboard.
- Verified end to end: a job walked all twelve steps to `succeeded`, wrote twelve
  `job_steps` rows and three `cost_ledger` rows (the three provider steps), and the worker
  returns 401 to a request with no token or a wrong one.

One deviation from law 5's spirit worth recording: `pnpm build` never worked on a cold
checkout (`TS6310` — `--noEmit` in `tsc -b` applies to referenced composite projects).
CI hid it because its typecheck job runs first and warms the graph. Fixed, and CI's
`pnpm build` is now a real check rather than a cached no-op.

### Providers ✅

`_shared/gemini.ts` and `_shared/config.ts` implement the environment-selected provider
set `architecture.md` has described since round 1. No key means stubs, so a fresh clone
still runs the whole pipeline. Verified against the live API, not mocked.

Three things that measurement changed:

- **Embeddings must be normalised client-side.** At a truncated 1536 dimensions Gemini
  returns vectors of length ~0.69, not 1. Every comparison in the read path is a cosine
  distance against an HNSW index; un-normalised vectors do not error, they rank wrongly.
- **Thinking tokens are output tokens.** A trivial prompt billed 5 visible output tokens
  and 157 reasoning tokens. Counting only `candidatesTokenCount` would have understated
  that call by ~97%, so `computeUsage` adds `thoughtsTokenCount`.
- **The newest model is not the right default.** `gemini-3.7-flash` and
  `gemini-flash-latest` both returned 503 under load while `gemini-3.6-flash` answered;
  `gemini-2.5-flash` 404s despite being listed. So the default is an ordered chain, and
  the model that actually answered is returned per call and recorded — a provider name
  pinned to the head of the chain would misattribute every fallback.

### The Delta is negation-aware ✅

**Current design (2026-09-22):** Suppression requires recall evidence for the reader's
own Pull or an approved, reviewed equivalence to one. Vector distance ranks but never
proves redundancy; a missing relation leaves the idea visible. The discussion below
records the earlier edge-exact vector design and its measured failure modes. The
current schema, evaluation, and rollout gates are in `docs/eval/delta-reliability.md`.

The Delta _treated_ cosine distance `< 0.14` as "the reader already knows this",
hardcoded across six migrations and tuned against synthetic concept-axis vectors. Measured
against real Gemini embeddings:

| distance        | verdict       | relationship                  |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 0.0635 · 0.0987 | covered ✓     | same idea, reworded           |
| **0.0618**      | **covered ✗** | **same topic, opposed claim** |
| 0.1474 · 0.1823 | new ✓         | related but distinct          |
| 0.2775 · 0.3423 | new ✓         | unrelated                     |

The ordering mostly survives, but _"spacing improves retention"_ and _"spacing offers no
benefit"_ are 0.0618 apart. Embeddings barely encode negation, so the Delta would file a
**contradiction** as already-known and hide it — precisely the material Counterpull and
the Conviction Ledger exist to surface.

**Re-tuning was the wrong framing, and it is worth recording why.** No value of the
threshold separates 0.0618 from 0.0987: an opposed claim sits _closer_ than a paraphrase,
so the ordering the constant relies on is not merely mis-calibrated, it is inverted. The
0.0618 is not a weak statement about redundancy — it is not a statement about redundancy
at all. It is an artifact of vectors that do not encode negation, and no constant recovers
information the vectors never carried.

So the fix is structural, and it does not exempt anything: opposed pairs are removed from
the comparison itself, and `covered` and `novelty_distance` then both come out right with
no special case downstream. A contradiction is judged against everything the reader knows
_except_ the ideas it contradicts — novel if nothing else is near it, redundant if it
genuinely duplicates something else. It earns its rank rather than being handed one.

Three things that building it changed:

- **An exemption is not enough, and the difference is measurable.** The first design
  exempted the candidate from `covered` and floored its novelty at the threshold. It was
  wrong: the contradiction survived the filter and then ranked **last** — 0.0268 against
  0.1380 and 0.1600 — because the floor is worth `0.12 × (0.14 − 0.0618) = 0.0094` of a
  score whose weights sum to 1.0, against the 0.12 a merely-novel card earns. It was not
  hidden by the filter; it was hidden by the scorer instead. `delta_negation.sql` asserts
  against that specific failure by requiring a contradiction to score identically for a
  reader who knows the opposed idea and one who knows nothing.
- **`kind = 'opposes'` cannot be an index condition under RLS.** `enum_eq` is not
  leakproof, so the planner may not push it below the security-barrier quals of
  `pull_relations_read_readable`; it lands in `Filter`, _after_ the policy, and every
  unrelated edge pays that policy in full. Two **partial** indexes fix it, because a
  partial index predicate is a plan-time constraint rather than a runtime qual and so
  escapes the leakproof rule entirely. Observed once on a seeded stack: at seed size the
  planner ignores them, and at a few thousand relations it switches to an index-only scan
  and `kind` disappears from `Filter`. Not yet a committed check — the plan shape would
  fit `db:test` and belongs there before it is quoted as fact.
- **Widening the exclusion through paraphrase is unsound, and no gate rescues it.** A
  reader knows a _claim_, usually through several phrasings, while only one carries an
  `opposes` edge — so the exclusion was widened to anything within the threshold of an
  opposed idea. That is the same blindness one level up: a contradiction is inside that
  threshold too, so the widening also dropped ideas the candidate _agreed_ with, and a
  reader holding both sides of a debate was served an idea they already held as maximally
  novel. Gating the widening on an `opposes` edge looked like the fix and is not: the
  widening exists _because_ edges are sparse, and the gate reads a missing edge as "not
  opposed". Both cannot be true of the same graph, and at ~0% annotation coverage the gate
  would essentially never fire. Two reviewers reproduced it independently, from different
  fixtures.

  So exclusion is edge-exact. That is **incomplete** — a reader who knows an unannotated
  restatement still has the contradiction hidden — and `delta_negation.sql` asserts the
  limitation rather than papering over it, so the day it stops holding somebody has to
  make a decision. Incomplete fails the way the old Delta already failed; the widening
  failed by serving known ideas as novel, which is a new way to be wrong. Closing it needs
  edges dense enough to describe claims rather than pulls — relation extraction's job.

- **The two Delta functions disagreed about how much a reader knows.** `get_feed` has
  always capped the known set at 500 by retrievability; `get_source_delta` capped nothing,
  so the same reader could get different answers. Survivable while the comparison was
  linear, and not once the paraphrase join made it quadratic in a whole history — measured
  at 327–423ms for 8,000 known ideas, on a function every source page calls. Capped to
  match. The negation work amplified this rather than inheriting it, which is why it is
  recorded here rather than filed as a pre-existing gap.

The constants now live in `delta_covered_distance()`, `known_retrievability_floor()`
and `known_comparison_cap()`,
so a re-tune is a one-line migration rather than an edit across superseded files. `0.1474`
sitting 0.007 from the cut still says the threshold deserves a real distribution rather
than one tuned by hand — but that measurement wants real embeddings, which is what this
unblocks, so it belongs after the backfill rather than before it.

**What this does and does not unblock.** Nothing writes `pull_relations`: the twelve
pipeline steps never emit edges, so every row in the database comes from the seed
migration. The exclusion is therefore live for the **seed** corpus — whose `opposes` edges
are hand-written — and inert for generated content until a step produces them. Backfilling
the seed corpus is now safe. Generated content needs the relation-extraction step below
first, or the Delta will suppress disagreement in exactly the material we generate.

### The pipeline writes content ✅

`runStep` runs the real twelve steps. Worth recording what that took, because the
first version of it looked finished and could not have completed a single job:

Four separate values were rejected by the database and by nothing above it —
`works.content_hash` (a column no migration created), `rights_status: 'user_private'`,
`work_kind: 'article'`, and `summaries.model` (another absent column) — while
`summaries.author_id` went unset, which `summary_is_readable` needs for a private
summary to be readable by the person who asked for it. TypeScript accepts any string,
the test fakes accept any string, PostgREST forwards it, and Postgres refuses at the
end, after the expensive call is paid for. The hosted project's zero generation jobs
had looked like nobody having tried one.

The lesson is narrow and worth keeping: a test that mocks the database cannot catch an
invalid enum member unless it asserts the member. Enum mirrors now live in
`pipeline.ts` with narrowing functions at the boundary, and the tests assert the values
that reach Postgres rather than the call counts alone. Unrecognised rights claims
narrow to `review_required`, so the direction a mistake falls in is toward refusing to
publish.

### Reuse is serialized ✅

Two jobs fingerprinting the same source could both pay a provider. `acquire` asked
whether a source was already summarised, and `synthesize` asked again immediately
before calling the provider — but they are separate invocations minutes apart on a
queue, so the answer could go stale in between and both could pay. The
adopt-on-`23505` in `createSummary` stopped that ending in a crash; what remained was a
duplicated bill, a law 2 failure whether or not anything throws.

`20260902200000` closes it by reserving the fingerprint: `synthesize` takes a
`generation_hash_claims` row after the re-check and before the call. A job told `held`
waits without spending a retry — the worker archives its message and re-sends the step
a minute later with a wait count, bounded at thirty — by which time the holder has
usually published and the re-check adopts its summary, so no provider is called at all.

The lease was the reason this was deferred, and two things make it safe. A claim whose
job is no longer queued or running is takeable at once, whatever the lease says, and
that — with the stranded-job sweeper — is what handles a dead holder. The lease itself
is for a holder that is alive but slow: a summary is not reusable until `publish`, and
the nodes between `synthesize` and `publish` can sit in a queue, so the lease is thirty
minutes and `template` renews it once the summary is committed. `hash_claims.sql`
asserts each takeover, that a live holder is never displaced, and that waiting archives
the delivered message and sends a delayed one.

### Still to do

Claim anchors — which is also where **relation extraction** belongs, since the Delta's
negation-awareness is inert on generated content until something writes `opposes` edges,
and the embedding backfill of generated summaries is gated on it. Then generated cards,
hero artwork, cost ledger reporting, rate limiting, and private user generation in the
Pull Studio.

Then public-domain ingest workers — Gutenberg, arXiv, Wikisource, open-access journals —
to grow the corpus without rights exposure.

## Round 3 — personal intelligence

Feed Builder with natural-language feed creation. Semantic search UI. Pull Graph
visualisation. Counterpull surfacing at scale. Ask this Pull. Personalised resurfacing.

The Depth Dial itself has landed early, on the card — it replaced the two-sided flip,
which sized its back face from its front and so scrolled internally whenever the deeper
text ran longer than the claim. What remains of the Round 3 item is the rest of the
sentence it was written as: the dial _across all media types_, which needs `sections`
rendered per medium (a paper's Method/Findings/Limitations against a film's
Themes/Craft/Context) rather than the four columns on `pulls` it reads today.

**Flashcards** have landed ahead of the round they belong to: a reader's own sets, made,
imported from Quizlet or Anki and studied four ways, free, private and offline
([`flashcards.md`](./flashcards.md)). Spaced review across sets is next.

## Round 4 — community

Profiles, follows, public stashes, publish, **fork** (with attribution and revision
history — the GitHub-shaped collaboration model that Deepstash has no equivalent for),
comments, reports, moderation, and the §512 rights workflow. The rights machinery must
land _before_ public UGC, not after.

## Round 5 — ads

Ad abstraction behind the existing feature flag. One clearly-marked native unit after
12–20 content cards, tuned from real retention data rather than a hardcoded ratio.
Rewarded ads only for expensive generation slots — never for knowledge features. No
app-open ads, and never an interruption mid-Pull.

## Round 6 — Capacitor

Only once the PWA is genuinely offline-capable.

```bash
npm i @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios
npx cap add ios && npx cap sync
```

Then selectively: native share sheet, background audio, haptics, camera page-scanning,
push notifications, universal links so `whatapull.vercel.app/pull/abc123` opens in-app, and a
native ad SDK.

## Known gaps carried out of round 1

Named here because they are inert rather than broken, and a reader of this repo should
not have to rediscover them.

- **`refresh_knowledge_vector` has a caller now, and the roadmap said otherwise for a
  day too long.** `20260901070000` added `refresh_stale_knowledge_vectors` and
  `enable_knowledge_vector_refresh()`, and the hosted project runs it every fifteen
  minutes (`cron.job`, checked 2026-09-02). So `user_knowledge_vectors` is populated and
  the `uvec` term -- 18% of `get_feed`'s score -- varies by reader as designed. Recorded
  here rather than silently deleted because the Fable 5.1 plan was written from this
  paragraph and repeated the gap as a finding; a stale "known gap" is worse than none,
  since a reader trusts it precisely because it sounds like a confession.
- **The Delta banner counts the pool, not the page.** At the default `p_limit` of 20,
  direct matches are counted in an 800-row candidate pool and reviewed equivalences
  in a 400-row shortlist. The current UI calls this the latest search's matches
  and describes the summed per-card estimates as estimated reading in those
  matches. It does not sum overlapping candidate pools across pages.
- **The duplicate `artworks` index is dropped; leaked-password protection is still a
  dashboard toggle.** `artworks_summary_idx` and `artworks_summary_readable_idx` were
  byte-identical — same table, same column, neither partial — and cost double on every
  write for nothing. `20260901170000` drops the later one, and `lint.sql` check 6 now
  fails CI on any pair of indexes with identical definitions, so the class is closed
  rather than the instance. It had been reported by the performance advisor and named
  here since round 1 precisely because nothing automated could see it.

  Leaked-password protection remains off and cannot be fixed from this repository; it is
  one switch in Authentication → Policies. The `enqueue_generation_job` advisory remains
  the one the project accepts by design, and `SECURITY.md` says so publicly so nobody
  spends a weekend rediscovering it.

- **`hnsw.ef_search` is set, and the reason is worth reading before changing it.**
  `search_catalogue` over-fetches `count(ranked) + 120` neighbours and `related_pulls`
  asks for 200, both reasoned about carefully in 20260901080000 — which never mentions
  that pgvector's candidate list defaults to **40**, and that an index scan therefore
  cannot return 200 rows however many are asked for. It returns about 40, with no error.

  It has not bitten, for an uncomfortable reason: at 370 pulls the planner ignores the
  HNSW index and scans, which is exact. So the arithmetic is correct today _because the
  optimisation it was written for is not in use_, and would have started quietly losing
  results on the day the corpus grew enough to use it. Set to 200 on the database in
  `20260901170000`, with a warning rather than a failure if the migration role may not
  ALTER DATABASE.

- **`packages/ranking` cannot run in a browser.** `seededUnit` needs a synchronous MD5
  and takes it from `node:crypto`. That is fine for its actual job — testing the
  placement rules over thousands of sessions without a database — but the prefetch use
  it was originally described as serving would need a pure-JS MD5 first. It is a
  devDependency now, which is what it has always in fact been.
- **A permanently-invalid queued write no longer retries forever.** `drainAndReschedule`
  keeps a timer alive while `hasPending` is true, and a write that can never succeed — a
  save for a pull deleted while the reader was offline — kept it true for the life of
  the tab. The obvious bound, giving up after N attempts, trades that for silently
  discarding something the reader did, which is why it stayed open. The fix is by
  SQLSTATE rather than by count: `isPermanentFailure` drops a write only when Postgres
  itself said the request cannot be satisfied (a foreign key to a row that is gone, a
  check violation, a malformed id), and everything it does not recognise stays queued.
  Not knowing is the same as transient. Two refinements the first cut got wrong: an RLS
  refusal is _not_ on the list, because a request whose session refresh failed goes out
  as `anon` and is refused with the same code; and a foreign key or check failure is
  judged per write, since a collection can point at a collection still in the queue.
  Text the reader composed is bounded in the inputs to the columns' limits instead,
  because a check violation kept in the queue would block its subject forever.
- **`acquire` was open to DNS rebinding. Closed, by inverting the check.** The host
  blocklist rejects private and link-local literals in both IPv4 and IPv6 and re-checks
  every redirect hop, so a public URL that 302s to `169.254.169.254` was refused. What
  it could not see was `evil.example.com` with an A record of `10.0.0.1`: the check is
  on the literal, and resolution happens inside `fetch`. It mattered because the worker
  holds a service-role key and writes what it fetched into `job_steps.output`, which the
  requester can read, and because `enqueue_generation_job` is reachable by any signed-in
  reader.

  The fix that was planned here — resolve the address, then pin the socket to it — is
  still not expressible in Deno's `fetch`, and waiting for it was the wrong move. An
  allowlist closes the same hole from the other side and needs no new capability:
  `evil.example.com` never reaches DNS at all, whatever it would have resolved to.
  `DEFAULT_SOURCE_HOSTS` in `_shared/source.ts` is the three hosts the entire 101-source
  manifest uses, overridable by `SOURCE_HOST_ALLOWLIST`, and a `*` value is refused
  rather than honoured. Matching is exact rather than by suffix, and the blocklist stays
  behind it so a carelessly widened allowlist still cannot reach loopback.

  What this gives up is the ability to summarise an arbitrary URL. No shipped screen
  offers that — nothing in `apps/web` invokes `enqueue` at all — so the capability lost
  is one only an operator had, and an operator can name a host. Worth revisiting when
  the Pull Studio makes reader-supplied URLs a real feature; at that point the
  allowlist becomes a per-request rights and egress decision rather than a constant.

- **`profiles` was a directory of everyone's email local-parts. Fixed.** `handle_new_user`
  derived the handle from `split_part(new.email, '@', 1)` and `profiles_read_all` was
  `for select using (true)`, so any caller holding the publishable key — which is
  committed, correctly — could page the table and read the local part of every
  registered address. It never mattered while the project had one account and a private
  repository; publishing changes both. `20260901120000` makes reads self-only on
  `profiles` and `follows`, generates handles randomly, and rewrites the rows that
  already carried an address. Neither table is read by a single line of `apps/web` —
  they are round 4 tables that were sitting open in a round 2 database — so nothing was
  given up. `docs/privacy.md` described the handle as optional and opt-in; that sentence
  was wrong on both counts and has been corrected rather than kept.

- **RLS is enabled one migration after the tables are created.** Law 5 in `CLAUDE.md`
  says "in the migration that creates it", and the schema does not do that: tables land
  in `20260829124548_learning.sql` and its siblings, policies in
  `20260829124730_rls.sql`. CI check 4 asserts the end state, so no environment that
  finishes migrating is exposed — but an environment that stops between the two is, and
  a table added to one of those files inherits the gap by default. Since migrations are
  append-only the split cannot be retrofitted; the choice is to keep the law as written
  and treat this as a standing deviation, or to reword it to describe what is actually
  enforceable. That is a decision for the repo owner, not a cleanup.

## Deliberately not planned

- A paid tier. The five free capabilities are the positioning; adding a subscription
  later would retract the one promise the product is built on.
- Engagement maximisation. The Enough screen and the time-saved metric are load-bearing,
  not decoration. Any metric that rewards longer sessions works against the thesis.
