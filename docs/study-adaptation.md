# Study adaptation: the study Delta

[`study-practice.md`](./study-practice.md) records answers, and
[`study-validation.md`](./study-validation.md) decides which answers prove recall. This page
covers what a course does with them: remembering each claim, knowing which lessons a reader
no longer needs, sending them back to what they got wrong, and asking again when memory
fades.

The schema is `supabase/migrations/20260925210000_study_memory.sql`, asserted in
`supabase/tests/study_memory.sql`. Everything here is SQL and arithmetic (law 2).

## The rule, and the risk it controls

The feed's Delta takes an idea out of the feed only on strict evidence that the reader knows
it ([`eval/delta-reliability.md`](./eval/delta-reliability.md)): false suppression -- hiding
what the reader does not in fact know -- is the first risk. The study Delta has the same
rule. A lesson is left out of a session only when every claim it teaches is known now, and a
claim is known only when all of these hold:

- the reader's last answer on it was a success -- a later wrong answer takes the knowledge
  away at once, and so does their own "not had" on a short answer, or a wrong answer to
  their own version of a question: neither is evidence to schedule by, but both are word
  that they do not have it now;
- that success still proves recall (`study_answer_proves_recall`), re-read every time, so a
  report or a withdrawal of the question or a claim since takes it away;
- its retrievability now is above 0.7, the feed's floor (`known_retrievability_floor()`,
  compared as the feed compares it) -- an old success expires;
- the claim is validated now.

Nothing else counts: being shown a lesson, reading it, a self-graded answer, a hinted one --
and an answer is hinted by a wrong or self-graded one in the half hour before to any question
on the same claim, so a second question on an idea just got wrong cannot clear the lapse --
an answer to the reader's own version of a question, an answer to a question held back, or an
answer in another reader's course. The suite asserts each of these as a case that must not
make a lesson known, under the reader's RLS. A lesson is known by every claim any version of
it cited: a reader's revision can add to what it must be known by, never take away from it.
A claim held back counts as not known there, rather than dropping out and leaving the rest to
call the lesson known; a claim withdrawn for good is no longer part of it.

What this protects against is the honest reader's false suppression, not a reader set on
fooling themselves: a question's answer and options are readable by its reader, on purpose,
so grading works offline. Nothing any reader does reaches another reader's course.

## The memory

`study_claim_memory` holds one row per reader per claim: stability, difficulty, repetitions,
lapses, the last outcome, and the answer that last proved it. It is written only by the
answer recorder, in the transaction that records the answer (`study_remember`); no API role
writes it, and the reader reads their own.

Retrievability is 0.9 ^ (days since the last success / stability), computed and never
stored, as for the feed. Stability a proof added stays if the proof is later withdrawn: the
claim is not known while the proof no longer stands, and the next proof grows from there.

## What the reader sees

- **Known lessons** are left out of sittings, without asking: that is the Delta. One not yet
  read -- known from a placement check or from review -- reads "You know this" in the
  outline ("Skipped · you know this" if skipped); one already read still reads "Read". The
  course page says how many are left out and that each opens from the outline, the end of a
  sitting counts them, and a placement check's result lists them as what the reader already
  knows -- from this rule, read again once the check's answers are in, never a second rule
  of the screen's own.
- **Faded lessons** -- known once, not now -- say "You knew this · time to refresh" (or
  "Read · time to refresh") rather than returning to the course silently. One unread comes
  back into sittings in its turn; one read is left to the review, where its questions come
  due. A proof withdrawn since -- its question reported or corrected -- also reads as faded,
  though nothing wore off: the proof no longer stands.
- **Lessons to revisit** -- read, and a claim this version teaches lapsed since it was last
  read -- read "Worth rereading", come first in the next sitting, open on a line saying why,
  and turn the course page's button into "Reread what you got wrong". Only a lesson read:
  one never read comes in its turn, so a wrong answer in a placement check does not move
  where the course starts. Reading it again answers it -- by the server's clock, as the
  lapse is timed -- so a sitting does not bring it back over and over; the claim stays due.
  Only while a question the model wrote can still clear the lapse: the reader's own
  versions never prove, and with only those left it could never go.
- **Due questions.** A question is due once answered, when the first claim it tests is due:
  half an hour after a lapse -- before then every answer to it is hinted and could not clear
  it -- otherwise one stability after the last success, when its recall has fallen to 0.9.
  Due is judged by the server's clock, and a reader's own version is never due. Practice
  after a lesson asks its due questions first, so a lapse can be cleared in the sitting; a
  review asks what is due, soonest first, and when nothing is due the course's review
  questions.
- **A right answer that counts for nothing** says so: when the server records a right answer
  as hinted by an answer on the same idea in the half hour before, the screen's "Right" is
  followed by "practice, not proof".

## The read path

- `study_claim_knowledge(course, at default null)` -- each validated claim of the current
  generation: `known`, `retrievability`, `due_at`, `lapsed`, `lapsed_at`. The `at` is for
  asking about another moment ("known a month from now?"), which the suite uses to test
  expiry; asked about the past, nothing proven since counts. Days are counted to at most a
  thousand stabilities, so no moment is out of range.
- `study_course_outline(course)` gains `known`, `revisit` and `faded`.
- `study_course_questions(course)` gains `due_at` and `due`, the columns
  [`study-courses.md`](./study-courses.md) promised rather than a fifth state.

The offline queue keeps a course's study answers in one order (`writeScope`): an answer is
hinted by a wrong one to any question on the same idea, and the memory moves in the order
answers arrive, so one held back holds back that course's answers after it -- not every
course's -- an answer held while the reader judges it keeps its course too. An answer given live, while earlier ones wait in the queue, reaches the server
first; the order holds among queued answers, and the hint's half hour, measured as answers
arrive, covers the rest.

A regeneration starts a new memory: its claims are new rows, and nothing carries over, as for
progress and answers.

## Locks

`study_remember` writes the memory inside the recorder, whose foreign key to the claim
key-shares it. A claim report or withdrawal locks the claim before its questions, so the
recorder key-shares a batch's claims, in id order, before it share-locks the batch's
questions: taken after them, a batch and a claim report deadlocked every time. See
[Lock order](./study-courses.md#lock-order).
