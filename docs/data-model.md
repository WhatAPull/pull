# Data model

81 tables in `public`, created by the timestamped migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
(`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name.sql`, applied in filename order). Every one has RLS enabled with
at least one policy, every foreign key has a supporting index, and every
`SECURITY DEFINER` function pins its `search_path`. CI check 4 replays the whole thing
from zero and asserts all of that.

The Shape below is the list, not an illustration of it. If it and the count disagree, the
Shape is the one to trust and the count is the one to fix — the previous number survived
being wrong precisely because the diagram had drifted with it and the two still agreed.

Schema `ops` holds no tables: aggregate views of study courses for operators, not exposed
through the API ([`study-beta.md`](./study-beta.md)).

## Decisions worth knowing

**Work vs. Edition.** _Blade Runner_'s three cuts and a book's four ISBNs are
distinct `editions` rows under one `works` row. Without this a citation can only
point at a title string; with it, it points at a real page in a real printing.

**Summaries are structured, not markdown.** `elevator_pitch`, `why_it_matters`
and a `sections` JSONB array rather than one blob. This is what makes the Depth
Dial free — the 30-second, 3-minute and 15-minute views are different subsets of
the same record, not separate generations. `sections` is JSONB because the shape
belongs to the medium: a paper has Method/Findings/Limitations where a film has
Themes/Craft/Context.

**Every grade is an event before it is a number.** `recall_events` keeps one row per
attempt — grade, stated confidence, what was typed, stability before and after, and
the `client_mutation_id` the client minted for it. `grade_recall` inserts that row
before it touches `knowledge_states`, so a retry of a lost response finds its own row
and returns the state untouched. The log is append-only through the API and is the
evidence a scheduler change is judged against.

**An imported highlight is an ordinary pull.** `commit_import` writes the same
works/summaries/pulls triple the pipeline does: a `works` row marked `user_owned`, a
summary the reader authors at `visibility = 'private'`, and one pull per highlight. There
is no second content path — Review schedules them and the Library holds them — and there
is no second privacy story either, because `get_feed` pools on
`published AND public` and `works_read_readable` hides a work whose only summary is
somebody else's. The `works` row is the reader's own — `imported_work_slug` hashes the
owner in alongside the title and author, so two readers importing one book get a row each.
It used to be one shared row, and that made it an oracle: the second importer read back
the first one's exact title casing and import timestamp through their own summary, which
is the one thing `works_read_readable` cannot hide, because the second reader can
legitimately see the row. `contributors` is namespaced the same way and for the same
reason. Nothing an import creates is shared with another reader. `import_items` carries the sha256 that makes a re-import a
no-op, and it deliberately outlives the pull it created, so Undo does not hand back
everything the reader just removed. Two mechanics do not reach them yet.
Search does not: `search_catalogue` filters `visibility = 'public'` in all three of its
branches, so a reader cannot find their own imported highlight through it. Nor does the
Delta: nothing writes `pulls.embedding` outside the generation pipeline, which imports
never enter, and `refresh_knowledge_vector` skips a null embedding. Neither is a leak —
nothing is exposed, something is absent — and each is a change of its own size. The
Delta's would need `docs/privacy.md`'s promise revisited first, since embedding a
reader's verbatim highlight is a model call over their own text.

**A private study source is versioned text, not a catalogue work.** The browser
extracts TXT, Markdown, PDF, DOCX, or opt-in OCR; the reader previews and corrects
the text before saving. `study_sources` identifies one owner-scoped source, while
`study_source_versions` appends each correction under a stable source id and mutation
id. The browser never uploads the original binary. A reader may delete a source and
all versions; account deletion also cascades. Direct writes to version rows are
denied, and another reader cannot read or delete them. See
[`study-import.md`](./study-import.md).

**What a generation is derived from, it cannot outlive.** Every study-generation row names
its version and owner through a composite foreign key on `(version, owner)`, so the
database refuses a derived row whose owner is not the version's. Deleting any version a
generation or a cache entry came from deletes the whole generation or entry (a trigger,
because a foreign key cannot delete a parent when one child goes) and cancels a job still
running; the course it belonged to goes with its last source. The provider
journal and ledger keep no content and are kept. See
[`study-generation.md`](./study-generation.md).

**A course is a container, and a generation is one version of it.** `study_courses` holds
the reader's goal and, in `study_course_sources`, the sources the course follows; each
`study_generations` row is one preparation of it from the versions it pinned. Regenerating
after a source changes adds a generation to the same course rather than a new course. The
current generation is the newest finished one with a lesson that was ever validated, else
with such a question, else the newest finished -- so a regeneration whose lessons were all
held back does not replace one the reader is studying, and nothing the reader does
afterwards, such as withdrawing lessons, moves the course back to an older one. A regeneration carries nothing over: its
lessons and questions are new rows. Within a generation, what the reader was shown, read or
skipped (`study_progress_events`) follows a lesson or question across the reader's own
corrections; answers and proof stay with the version answered. A course goes with its last
source, or through `delete_study_course`; its sources stay. It shares no key with the public
`paths`, which are curated and keyed to public pulls. See
[`study-courses.md`](./study-courses.md).

**A reader's own question lives in its own table.** `user_questions` rather than a row in
`quiz_questions`, because the pipeline upserts canonical questions with
`on conflict (pull_id, kind)` and a partial unique index added to make room for reader
rows would change what that upsert resolves against. `get_due_reviews` puts the reader's
own unretired questions first and says of each which it is, so `recall_events` can file
the grade against `user_question_id` rather than the canonical foreign key.

**A question has a kind, and the kind is checked.** `quiz_questions.kind` is one of
`recall`, `mcq`, `cloze`, `short_answer`, `ordering` or `scenario`; a question also
carries an `explanation` (why the answer is the answer, shown whatever the reader
picked), a `cloze` sentence, and a `rationale` — an array of `{distractor, why}`, which
is an array rather than a map because Gemini has no map type. The three kinds
`lib/activities.ts` grades deterministically are MCQ, cloze and ordering; the other three
stay self-graded, because marking a paragraph a reader composed would be a model call per
answer and law 2 says no.

Two rules live in the table rather than in the generator, because the generator is a
model. An `mcq` needs at least two distractors — with one it is a coin flip and with none
the answer is the only thing on screen — and a `cloze` needs its blank, or there is
nothing for the reader to fill. `user_questions` carries `explanation` and `cloze` too,
but only the first four kinds: `ordering` and `scenario` are generated forms that a prompt
and an answer cannot express.

**Neither of those two rules is on `user_questions`, and that is deliberate.**
`remember_pull` — the RPC the product writes these rows through — has no parameter for
`options` or `cloze`, so a constraint requiring either would refuse every call it makes
for that kind, permanently, as a 400 from PostgREST. A constraint the only writer that
matters cannot satisfy forbids a kind rather than guarding one. Both wait for the screen
that can supply the missing column.

It is not that the columns are unwritable: `user_questions_insert_own` places no
restriction on which columns a row carries, so a signed-in reader can POST either
straight to `/rest/v1/user_questions` — and this migration's own blank-prompt rule exists
because that path is real. The point is narrower and it is about the RPC. Recorded here
because this file is what someone reads before adding the obvious missing constraint.

`get_due_reviews` returns up to three questions per card, the reader's own first. The
three singular fields beside them — `question`, `questionId`, `questionSource` — are read
off `questions[0]` rather than computed next to it, so they cannot come to describe a
different question than the one returned; they exist for one release, until the Review
screen renders the array.

**Retrievability is computed, never stored.** `knowledge_states` holds
`stability` and `last_seen_at`; `public.retrievability()` derives the current
value on read. A cron job that rewrote every row nightly would not scale, and a
row it had not reached yet would be indistinguishable from a fresh one.

**Convictions are append-only.** A new stance sets `superseded_by` on the old
one rather than overwriting it, so "how my mind changed" stays queryable. A
partial unique index on `(user_id, pull_id) where superseded_by is null` makes
"what do they believe _now_" an index lookup rather than a window function over
their whole history.

**Lineage and counterpoints share one edge table.** `pull_relations.kind` covers
`related`, `opposes`, `elaborates`, `ancestor`, `descendant` and `supports`. Counterpull
reads the `opposes` edges; Idea Lineage walks `ancestor`/`descendant`. A kind describes
the `to` pull relative to the `from` pull, so the same edge reads differently from each
end; `related_pulls` says which side the anchor is on (`direction`), and the client keeps
one label map per side.

The Delta uses `delta_relations` for reviewed, unordered Pull pairs. Only an approved
`equivalent` edge can suppress a different idea, and only when the reader has recent
successful recall or explicitly marked its counterpart as already known. The latest server-applied relevant attempt and its recorded stability set the
evidence window; a delayed offline success cannot erase a later applied failure.
Legacy attempts without recorded stability cannot prove recall. Opening or
calibrating a card cannot refresh an expired recall. Missing vectors and missing
relations leave an unverified idea visible.

Legacy `pull_relations` opposition and approved `delta_relations` opposition work in
either storage direction. They remove the opposed known claim from vector ranking and
veto a conflicting equivalence for that pair. Embedding distance is a ranking clue,
not proof of redundancy. The follow-up migration revokes write and TRUNCATE grants on the relation table,
and get_summary_delta counts one selected summary for the Source page.
Disabling a bad reviewed edge stops its read-path effect
without deleting any reader's recall history. See `docs/eval/delta-reliability.md`.

**Interleave tunables live in a table.** `interleave_config` is a single-row
table with a `check (id)` singleton constraint, so the question rate can be
tuned from real usage without a deploy. A check constraint enforces that the
five type weights sum to 100.

**A path has an end.** `paths` and `path_steps` curate sequences of ideas that answer
one overarching question through a progression of activities (`read`, `predict`,
`compare`, `say_it_back`, `apply`). `path_progress` and `path_step_done` track the
reader's journey and allow testing out of ideas already held solid. `apply_path_step`
writes a private reflection note, pulls forward the next due date within 3 days, and
advances the path idempotently via `client_mutation_id`.

**Cost data is not user-facing.** `cost_ledger`, `budget_reservations`,
`moderation_decisions` and the study beta's `study_release_gates`, `study_beta_settings` and
`study_beta_log` have RLS enabled with a policy of `using (false)` —
service-role only. That is deliberate, not an oversight: the invariant check
requires _a_ policy to exist, not that it grants anything. The study beta's three are
narrower still: the service role only reads them, and the database owner writes them.

**The daily spend cap is a reservation, not a reading.** `budget_reservations` is
keyed `(job_id, step)` and counts the calls standing behind that row: a step whose
earlier hold is settled takes the row over, so a retry is not refused against money
nobody is spending, while a step the queue hands out again while its first call is
still inside the provider ADDS to the hold — two calls spend twice, and a cap that
cannot see the second is not a cap. `reserve_budget` takes one **global** advisory
lock before it counts — two different jobs must not both read the same total and both proceed,
which is precisely the case a per-job lock would leave in contention.
`record_job_step` settles in the same transaction as the ledger row, so the hold and
the charge are never both counted. `spend_today()` sums the ledger and open
reservations and never `generation_jobs.cost_cents`, which is a second copy of every
ledgered charge. See `20260914010000` and `docs/generation.md`.

## Policy posture

- **User-owned data** — the owner only, via `(select auth.uid()) = user_id`.
  Wrapping `auth.uid()` in a scalar subquery lets Postgres evaluate it once per
  query instead of once per row.
- **Canonical content** — world-readable once `status = 'published'`; written
  only by the service role, which bypasses RLS. A `works` row is visible only when
  one of its summaries is readable by the caller (published and public, or their
  own), so a source with nothing readable behind it is not enumerable.
- **Write policies are split** into INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE rather than `for all`
  wherever a separate read policy exists, so no read pays for two overlapping
  permissive policies. Enforced by invariant 5 in `supabase/tests/lint.sql`.
