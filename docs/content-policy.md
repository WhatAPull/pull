# Content policy and rights

> This is a product-design risk posture, not legal advice. An attorney familiar with
> copyright should review the ingestion and publication system before public launch.

## The principle

Copyright does not protect ideas, procedures, concepts or discoveries — but it does
protect expression, and the statutory definition of a derivative work expressly includes
**abridgments and condensations**. A summary is therefore not automatically safe, and
there is no word count or percentage below which copying is automatically fine.

So What a Pull is built as an **analysis product**, not a substitution product.

## What we publish

| Prefer                      | Avoid                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Ideas and arguments         | Chapter-by-chapter replacement text           |
| Commentary and criticism    | Long quotations                               |
| Applications and examples   | Reproduced passages                           |
| Cross-source comparison     | "Here is effectively the whole book, shorter" |
| Questions and counterpoints | Scene-by-scene retellings                     |

For **film and television** this matters most. Detailed plot retellings have been
litigated precisely because they can substitute for experiencing the work. So:

**Not this**

> Scene 1 happens. Then Character A says X. Then Character B does Y. Then the ending is…

**This**

> **Central idea: memory and identity.** The film asks whether identity comes from
> objective history or from the memories through which a person understands it.
> **How the film explores it:** unreliable perspective, visual motifs, and deliberate
> ambiguity about the protagonist's past.

That is both the more defensible use and the better learning product.

## Rights status is a first-class field

Every `works` row carries one:

- `public_domain` — the easiest place to build a rich launch corpus, and where our seed lives
- `licensed`
- `user_owned` — a user's own document, private by default. This is what an imported
  highlight becomes: `commit_import` writes the source with this status and the reader's
  summary of it at `visibility = 'private'`, so it can never be pooled into the feed, never
  reaches canonical generation, and is invisible to every reader but the one who imported
  it. Verbatim text is defensible here and nowhere else in the product, because it is one
  reader's own copy of their own reading rather than something we publish
- `public_reference` — publicly accessible material referenced with attribution
- `community` — contributed, subject to the UGC workflow below
- `review_required` — the default for anything unresolved; not publishable

## The repository is not the database

```
OPEN SOURCE REPOSITORY          ≠        HOSTED SERVICE DATA
code · schemas · prompts                 generated summaries
sample public-domain content             community submissions
tests                                    licensed metadata · user libraries
```

**Never commit** copyrighted book text, screenplay text, transcripts we lack rights to,
pirated PDFs or ripped media. This is enforced socially in review and stated in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`; there is no automated check that can catch it, so it needs attention.

## User-generated content

**A private summary is not publication, and the distinction is the whole of why the Studio
is shippable today.** A reader may ask for a summary of their own document — pasted text, a
URL, or the highlights they imported — and what comes back is `visibility = 'private'` with
`rights_status = 'user_owned'`: readable by its requester through `summary_is_readable`,
never in `get_feed`, never in the catalogue, never unfurled by the Open Graph function
(which reads with the anon key), and deleted with the account. Nobody else can reach it, so
the service is not hosting it for anybody.

Three things hold that line rather than one comment: `enqueue_generation_job` refuses to
carry a `visibility` the client sent, the job's own column defaults to private, and the
pipeline's `moderate` step re-checks rights immediately before publication — so a job that
is not cleared cannot become public even if something earlier said it could. A reader's
private document is theirs to summarise; the same summary made public is a different act,
and it is the act this section's machinery is for.

Once users publish generated summaries or uploads, the hosted service becomes a host of
third-party material and needs the §512 machinery before that launches:

```
Report infringement → rights queue → disable/investigate
   → notify contributor → counter-notice where applicable → resolution
```

Backed by: a designated agent and a public copyright-contact process, a repeat-infringer
policy, user reporting, moderation logs, content hashes and version history. The
`rights_requests` and `moderation_decisions` tables exist for exactly this and are in the
schema from the start, before the feature that needs them.

There is a commercial reason too: ad networks prohibit monetising infringing content, so
getting this wrong breaks the funding model as well as the legal position.

## Public study courses

A study course the project publishes is analysis of a work, not a copy of it: prepared by an
account the project named as a curator, from text registered as the work's, of a work whose
`rights_status` is `public_domain` or `licensed`; reviewed by a person; and quoting the work
only in capped excerpts, which the schema refuses to exceed. Passages quoted within 200
characters of each other count as one quotation, gap and all, and a quotation is at most 300
characters; and the courses published -- a withdrawn one too, whose readers keep their
copies -- quote between them at most a tenth of each registered text, whatever work each is
of, and a work's courses at most 20,000 characters of it, a passage two courses quote counted
once. What the course says in its own words may not repeat twelve words in a row of the work
from outside its quotations. The source itself is never published.

The schema cannot tell a close paraphrase from analysis, nor whether the registered text is
the whole work; the review is the control for those. A course can be withdrawn, and for a
rights complaint every reader's copy removed after it. See
[`study-public-courses.md`](./study-public-courses.md).

## Attribution

Every Pull keeps its source identity, links back to a legitimate original, and carries
claim-level `citation_anchors` where possible. This is also the answer to the most common
criticism of micro-content — that it dead-ends with no way into the real material.
