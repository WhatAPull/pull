-- What a guest session may and may not do, exercised as a guest.
--
-- Anonymous sign-in changes the meaning of `to authenticated` across the whole schema:
-- a guest holds the same role as a reader who typed a code from their inbox, and
-- `auth.uid()` returns a real uuid for them. Everything keyed to a user therefore works
-- for a guest with no special case, which is the point -- and two doors that were safe
-- while every account cost a mailbox stop being safe when accounts are free.
--
-- The assertions are in both directions on purpose, because a bound that also blocks
-- legitimate use is a worse bug than the one it fixes, and because half of these could
-- pass for the wrong reason:
--
--   * a guest can finish onboarding and read their own preferences -- if this breaks,
--     the guest button leads to a dead end and the feature is pointless
--   * a guest cannot enqueue generation, author a summary, or file a report
--   * a guest can keep a private note, stash and feed recipe, and cannot make any of
--     them public -- by inserting one public or by flipping one they already own
--   * a reader with an address can still do all three -- so the refusals above are
--     about being a guest and not about something else that broke
--   * the bounds that apply to everyone are still in force: the free allowance is
--     immediate, the delay past it grows, and the daily ceiling refuses. `create or
--     replace` on a fixed signature makes those easy to revert by accident, and every
--     other assertion here would still pass if they were gone
--   * the sweep deletes a stale guest and leaves the reader alone
--   * the sweep's DEFAULT is one day, and one day is measured from disuse -- a guest
--     who refreshed two hours ago survives it and one who refreshed twenty-five hours
--     ago does not. Asserted against the default rather than an explicit interval,
--     because the default is the only value pg_cron ever passes
--
-- Run as the roles that actually reach these paths (`authenticated`, with and without
-- the `is_anonymous` claim), because RLS is invisible to an owner-role query and this
-- file would otherwise be proving nothing.
--
-- Read-only in effect: everything below rolls back.
