-- Study courses: adaptation. A memory of each claim, kept from the answers that can prove
-- it, and the study Delta read from it: which lessons a reader already knows, which to
-- revisit, and which questions are due.
--
-- The rule is the feed Delta's (docs/eval/delta-reliability.md), and false suppression is
-- the first risk it controls: a lesson is taken out of a session only on strict evidence
-- that its every claim is remembered now. Exposure, a self-graded answer, a hinted one, an
-- answer to the reader's own version or to a question held back, and any answer followed by
-- a wrong one prove nothing -- and the reader's own "not had" takes knowledge away as a
-- wrong answer does. An old success expires with its stability. A report or a withdrawal
-- after the proof withdraws it, because the proof is re-read, not remembered.
--
-- Scheduling is FSRS-shaped, as `grade_recall` is: a success when the claim was due
-- multiplies stability, a lapse cuts it back and raises difficulty. Retrievability is
-- 0.9 ^ (days / stability), never stored. A question is due when the claims it tests have
-- fallen below 0.9, or lapsed.

 * Move the memory of each claim an answer tests. Called by the recorder, in its transaction,

 *
 *   an answer that proves recall   a success. Stability grows as `grade_recall`'s good does,
 *                                  2 + (1 - difficulty) times, on the first success, or on a
 *                                  success following a success once the claim was due -- a
 *                                  stability had passed since the last. Before then, answering
 *                                  again is repetition, not spacing, and stability stays: a
 *                                  proof every few hours cannot compound it into years. And a
 *                                  proof after a lapse of a claim once proven -- scored or the
 *                                  reader's own "not had" -- is relearning, not spacing: it
 *                                  restores knowledge and leaves stability as the lapse left
 *                                  it, or a reader missing a claim at every due review, and
 *                                  proving it half an hour later, would be sent past it for
 *                                  years. A claim never proven grows on its first success,
 *                                  lapse or none: there is nothing yet to relearn.
 *   a wrong answer that scores     a lapse: stability to 0.35 of itself (at least half a day),
 *                                  difficulty up 0.15. It takes knowledge away at once. It
 *                                  scores where a right answer would have proved: graded
 *                                  deterministically, to a question the model wrote, validated
 *                                  when answered and now, on validated claims.
 *   any other wrong answer, and    no evidence to schedule by -- the reader's own judgement or
 *   the reader's own "not had"     version, or a key they have said is wrong -- but word that
 *                                  the claim is not remembered now: it takes knowledge away as
 *                                  a lapse does, and leaves stability and difficulty as they
 *                                  were.
 *   anything else                  nothing. A right self-grade, and a right answer that is
 *                                  hinted, to the reader's own version or to a question held
